# Generative AI Course Contents
 This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks / Assignments provided during an internship training program. Topics include Advanced NLP, Neural Network and other Data Science&ML fields. 
 - CNN
 - Bag of Words and Byte Pair Encoding
 - Long Short Term Memory ( LSTM ) Model
 - Transformer Based Model
 - ChatGPT 2.0 and Google Gemma Model Training,Prompt and Fine-Tuning KerasNLP Models using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
 - Retrieval Augmented Generation ( RAG ) Model

#### NOTE : I would highly Suggest going to Kaggle link and accessing the notebooks there. Since all the implementation are done there. These notebooks can be run on local machines but the datasets and libraries must be installed locally, the models are also large which is resourse intensive and hence may not be supported to be run on regular use computers.

- Visit the link
- Go to the 'Code' section to find the Notebooks.

Thank You..
